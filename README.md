# GECCO---DynStack-2023-Competition
Competition on Dynamic Stacking Optimization in Uncertain Environments. In this competition your goal is to write a policy that optimizes crane actions in simulated environments.
Your policy receives the current simulation state as input in intervals of 1 second and may send a crane schedule in response or at any other time that contains moves for the crane, e.g. relocate block 15 from stack 1 to stack 2. You have to run your policy on your own machine communicating with our simulation environment in real time. You can develop and test your policy against various training settings and score it for a final ranking against unknown settings. The policies are ranked based on a lexicographic objective as explained further below and in more detail in the documentation of the respective tracks. Leaderboards are available.
