# GECCO---DynStack-2023-Competition

Competition on Dynamic Stacking Optimization in Uncertain Environments. In this competition your goal is to write a policy that optimizes crane actions in simulated environments.

Your policy receives the current simulation state as input in intervals of 1 second and may send a crane schedule in response or at any other time that contains moves for the crane, e.g. relocate block 15 from stack 1 to stack 2. You have to run your policy on your own machine communicating with our simulation environment in real time. You can develop and test your policy against various training settings and score it for a final ranking against unknown settings. The policies are ranked based on a lexicographic objective as explained further below and in more detail in the documentation of the respective tracks. Leaderboards are available.

Motivation: Stacking problems are central to multiple billion-dollar industries. The container shipping industry needs to stack millions of containers every year. In the steel industry the stacking of steel slabs, blooms, and coils needs to be carried out efficiently, affecting the quality of the final product. The immediate availability of data thanks to the continuing digitalization of industrial production processes makes the optimization of stacking problems in highly dynamic environments feasible.

Rules: Everyone is invited to participate in this competition. The results will be presented during the respective host event where the winner and possibly runner-ups will be announced. It is usually not required to attend the host event in order to participate in this competition. We will forward any official participation or winning certificates to the winner through mail.

Deadline: To be eligible for winning the competition you must complete all scoring simulation runs before the deadline of the respective track.
